### Scooter for Devs

Prime directive:
* this app was written in anger to solve a problem
* **all versions must allow someone to award a door-prize by simply munging an attendee list into a text/JS file**
* contributions are welcome, but please ensure that tests pass and that functionality is intact

Requires:
* [Gradle](http://gradle.org)
* [Python](http://www.python.org/)

One Way To Test Jasmine Specs:
* `./test.sh`
* open dev.html as file and use test link

One Way To Run the App:
* `./run.sh`
* open dev.html as file and use run link (it adds a token so caching isn't a problem)
