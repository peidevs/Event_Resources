#### Lessons learned

* Does the venue allow minors? If minors attend, someone should stay with them until their rides arrive (?)
* Consider using a timer, esp. for lightning talks. A standard technique is to demo a funny alarm, before the talks begin, and tell everyone that we are setting a timer. In this way, no one is offended by being cut off.
* at CYC, a presenter wanted to play audio clips. We rented cables and an adapter box at Long & McQuade so that we could plug a stereo-mini jack into a Mac, and then a XLR (?) jack into the sound board.
* for long events (e.g. hackathons), be sure to vacate the premises on time. The security staff get upset if we linger around.
* Some elders have registered the notion that the name "hackathon" does not encourage gender-diversity

#### Lessons learned for coding workshops

* All material must be available on the web prior to the event, for reference, and to reduce reliance on projector display
* For remote facilitators, prefer Google Hangout over Skype
* For remote facilitators, plan to have helpers on the floor in the local venue

#### Older stuff

* who prints the "Hello my name is ..." labels? 
* confirm venue, food, speakers, Wifi details
* are there door prizes? is Scooter configured?
