#### before booking speakers

* Ask other elders if there any committed speakers for the upcoming month. We have a history of getting wires crossed when Cat Herder A takes over for Cat Herder B.
* check the following:
    * [PendingMeetUps.md](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/PendingMeetUps.md)
    * [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues)

#### 2+ weeks in advance

* Remember, if you are the [Cat Herder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding_cats), feel free to delegate tasks. You don't have to do it all yourself. **Thank you** for taking this on!
* do the speakers know how much time they have to present?
* do the speakers have appropriate dongles for the projector?
* do non-regular speakers know they can use a projector, and the # of people in attendance?

#### 1 week in advance

* announce/tweet MeetUp (this can be done sooner if things are set)
    - Note that Meetup will remove the Announce button, if it is not announced within 7 days of the event. According to [this](https://help.meetup.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002864932-Announcing-your-events#:~:text=If%20you%20don't%20make,one%20day%20before%20the%20event.), there is an auto-announce feature that kicks in.
* ask speakers how they would like to be introduced / bio
* update [monthly outline](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.md) with speakers, sponsors, announcements, etc. We use this as a slide before Speaker #1.
    * It is wise to ask for announcements in the `#general` channel on Slack (or Twitter?) to ensure that we get everything.
* update the [human-readable log](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.md)

#### 1-2 days prior to event

* send out an email reminder
* arrange for PEI Vax Pass bouncers at the door

#### on night of the event (for regular MeetUps)

* generally, the Cat Herder is the emcee. If no other arrangements have been made, s/he will read the announcements, etc
* the Cat Herder is also the "time police" and should tell the speakers when they have 5 minutes to go

#### after the event

* Startup Zone co-ordinator asked us to:
    * ensure that the projector is retracted
    * ensure that dishes are put in the dishwasher and not left in the sink
* update the [csv log](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.csv) with the attendance (the # of sign-ups on MeetUp is good enough)
* the cat-herder is generally responsible to find the next cat-herder for the next event/stint
