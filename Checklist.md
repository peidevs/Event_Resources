#### repeating tasks

* Please check the peidevs email account on a regular basis (every 7-10 days or so)

#### before booking speakers

* Ask other elders if there any committed speakers for the upcoming month. We have a history of getting wires crossed when Cat Herder A takes over for Cat Herder B.
* check the following:
    * [PendingMeetUps.md](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/PendingMeetUps.md)
    * [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues)

#### 2+ weeks in advance

* obviously, confirm venue, food, speakers, Wifi details
* Remember, if you are the [Cat Herder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herding_cats), feel free to delegate tasks. You don't have to do it all yourself. **Thank you** for taking this on!
* do the speakers know how much time they have to present?
* do the speakers have appropriate dongles for the projector?
* do non-regular speakers know they can use a projector, and the # of people in attendance?

#### 1 week in advance

* announce/tweet MeetUp (this can be done sooner if things are set)
* ask speakers how they would like to be introduced / bio
* update [monthly outline](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.md) with speakers, sponsors, announcements, etc. We use this as a slide before Speaker #1.
* update the [human-readable log](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.md)

#### 1-2 days prior to event

* send out an email reminder
* are there door prizes? is Scooter configured?

#### on night of the event (for regular MeetUps)

* generally, the Cat Herder is the emcee. If no other arrangements have been made, s/he will read the announcements, handle the door prizes, etc
* the Cat Herder is also the "time police" and should tell the speakers when they have 5 minutes to go
* afterwards, update the [csv log](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/blob/master/MeetUps.csv) with the attendance (the # of sign-ups on MeetUp is good enough)

#### Lessons learned
* Does the venue allow minors? If minors attend, someone should stay with them until their rides arrive (?)
* Consider using a timer, esp. for lightning talks. A standard technique is to demo a funny alarm, before the talks begin, and tell everyone that we are setting a timer. In this way, no one is offended by being cut off.
* at CYC, a presenter wanted to play audio clips. We rented cables and an adapter box at Long & McQuade so that we could plug a stereo-mini jack into a Mac, and then a XLR (?) jack into the sound board.
* for long events (e.g. hackathons), be sure to vacate the premises on time. The security staff get upset if we linger around.
* Some elders have registered the notion that the name "hackathon" does not encourage gender-diversity

#### Lessons learned for coding workshops
* All material must be available on the web prior to the event, for reference, and to reduce reliance on projector display
* For remote facilitators, prefer Google Hangout over Skype
* For remote facilitators, plan to have helpers on the floor in the local venue

#### Older stuff
* who prints the "Hello my name is ..." labels?
