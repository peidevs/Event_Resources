## Emcee/Hosting events

Here are some tips for being the emcee/host at meetups:

* Be empathetic to those who are there for the first time
    - introduce yourself: not everyone knows who you are
    - explicitly ask if anyone is new to the group
    - if there are newbies, introduce the group: visit the website, explain our Slack, etc
    - e.g. some university students may not even know what Slack is
* Time Management
    - remove the burden of time management from the speaker
    - give them a 5-minute warning so they can wrap-up coherently
    - enforce time boundaries so people can ask questions
