# Updating the PEI Devs Website

Steps to update:

1. Go to https://forestry.io/
2. Login (I think PEI Devs log in with GitHub, unless you've previously held an account and it was given PEI Devs group access)
3. Choose PEIDevs Organization
4. Choose peidevs.github.io site

From here, you'll have access to create and edit content. For specifics, it is best to look up Forestry's official documents. But the following sections are simple guides to do the most common things.

## Create a Blog Post

1. Select Blog Posts from the left-hand menu
2. Click *Create New* (near the top) 
3. Choose *Blog Posts* (sic)
4. Fill your meta data in the boxes on the left, and your content in the big box to the right
5. To preview a change, you can click the Eye icon next to the draft on/off toggle in the upper right of the page editor. It can take a while, so be patient. There will be a fully render page at an incredibly weird and temporary URL.
6. Click *Save Draft* to save any changes
7. To publish, toggle draft "off" and click the *Save* button (which used to be *Save Draft*)

## Change the Navigation Links, 

1. Choose *Menus* from the left-hand side. Then you'll see a tabbed view. 
2. There will be *SIDE* and *MAIN* tabs. Side is the right-hand side of the PEI Devs site, and MAIN are the links along the top navigation bar.
3. Click *Add Link* to add a new link
4. Use the three-line (Hmaburger) icons to rearrange the links by clicking and dragging
5. Click the gear to edit a link
6. Click the trash icon to delete a link
