Welcome to the PEI Devs Slack team!

### Handy Guide to Channels

Here's a list of our most popular channels:

* `#general` - general discussion 
* `#intros` - **if you're new** to our Slack, say hello here. Feel free to write a brief bio with your interests etc.
* `#jobs` - job postings
* `#peidevs` - coding, or the PEI Devs group itself
* `#bookclub` - a reading group, often hosted in Summerside 
* `#opendata` - discussion on Open Data and Open Gov (formerly the _Open Data Book Club_)
* `#q_and_a` - Questions and Answers on tech topics
    * Stuck with a problem? Brain-storming an idea? Maybe someone can help out.
    * Note that Slack is not necessarily the ideal medium for big topics
        * But don't let that deter you. If a topic is too large, someone might (?) suggest getting coffee or chatting at a MeetUp.
    * Be sure to discern fact from opinion. Techies can be quite opinionated :-)
* `#market` - sell stuff, or find a home for free stuff

### The Obligatory Formal Stuff

Please note that Slack is a public forum that reflects on the reputation of PEI Devs. So, we have a [Code of Conduct](http://peidevs.github.io/code/). Please check it out (the gist is "Act like you're in public, at one of our meet-ups").

### Glossary

Here are some common phrases we use:

* **Elders** Our planning committee is often called "Elders". See a list [here](http://peidevs.github.io/about/#elders)
* **Cat-Herder** The cat-herder is the Elder who has volunteered to organize the MeetUp for the current month. S/he is a captain of sorts who delegates tasks and acts as emcee. 
* **Coffee and Code** Sometimes devs will get together and work for the day at a coffee shop. It's a combo of being social while working your daily gig.

### Thanks

Thanks for joining! We're looking forward to hanging out...
