Welcome to the PEI Devs Slack team!

### Handy Guide to Channels

Here's a list of our most popular channels:

* `#general` - general discussion 
* `#jobs` - job postings
* `#peidevs` - coding, or the PEI Devs group itself
* `#bookclub` - a reading group, often hosted in Summerside 
* `#opendata` - discussion on Open Data and Open Gov (formerly the _Open Data Book Club_)
* `#blockchain` - discussion on, well ... 

### The Obligatory Formal Stuff

Please note that Slack is a public forum that reflects on the reputation of PEI Devs. So, we have a [Code of Conduct](http://peidevs.github.io/code/). Please check it out (the gist is "Act like you're in public, at one of our meet-ups").

### Thanks

Thanks for joining! We're looking forward to hanging out...
