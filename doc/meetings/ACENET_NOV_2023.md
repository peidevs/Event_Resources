We provide access to local infrastructure with thousands of compute cores for R&D the involves big data processing and analysis, machine learning, large and complex modelling, and calculations that regular computers simply can't handle. Supercomputers are being used in developing new materials, engineering structures, aerospace, cleantech, mapping, pharma, oceantech and agritech. Areas as wide-ranging as nanotechnology, advanced manufacturing, artificial intelligence, genomics, and health research increasingly rely on supercomputers. Our local support team provides specialized expertise, help, troubleshooting and skills development for novice through advanced supercomputer users.
