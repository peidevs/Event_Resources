### Intro

This informal doc has some ideas for open forums.

An 'open forum' can be useful as a last resort. e.g. when a speaker can't make it, a castastrophic A/V issue, etc. It is wise to have some 'seed' ideas/thoughts beforehand, so as to encourage dialogue.

### Ideas

* Over-Rated, Under-Rated, or Fairly-Rated
    - state a concept and invite arguments as to whether the industry has hyped it too much, or not enough
    - e.g. Java, cloud-computing, TDD, etc
* Unpopular Opinions
    - invite unpopular opinions
    - e.g. "I prefer a simple editor to an IDE"
* Deep Dive
    - state a concept and start a white-board discussion to explain the concept as deep as possible
    - e.g. a user hits refresh in the browser: what happens?
    - this could go as deep as DNS, TCP/IP, etc  
* Technology Struggle
    - confess a technology that consistently befuddles you, and then invite others to reveal their own
    - e.g. Webpack, CSS, etc 
* Ghastly Bugs and Production Issues
    - analogous to telling ghost stories around a camp-fire
    - talk about a chilling bug or "production issue" and invite others to describe their own
