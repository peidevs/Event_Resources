### Details

Hello PEI Devs! 

We meet again on Thursday, June 12, 7 pm at [The Foundry](https://peiitalliance.com/the-foundry), [163 Great George St.](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=46.23629%2C%20-63.128113).

This month is an "un-session" where we basically hang out for a social hour. However, we'll kick off the evening with some tech ice-breakers, designed to elicit audience participation. The format is incubating but may include:

* "Would You Rather?"
    * the obvious example: tabs vs spaces
    * a spicier example: static typing vs dynamic typing
* "Underrated, Fairly-rated, or Overrated?" 
    * the obligatory example: AI
    * a spicier example: unit-tests

We'll poll the audience, but also provide an open invitation to defend your position. If you would like to submit any specific provocations, send a DM to Michael Easter on [our Slack](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScjMRLiiKXqeHCjCSAD37mFxJdH5fskiok-LUaIGtPUZ63glw/viewform?pli=1).
