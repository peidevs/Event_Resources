### Details

Hello PEI Devs!

We meet again on Thursday, June 12, 7 pm at [The Foundry](https://peiitalliance.com/the-foundry), [163 Great George St, Charlottetown, PEI](https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&query=46.23629%2C%20-63.128113).

Blurb here: Our lightning talks are 7 minutes in length: show us what you've created with AI (or how AI has improved your workflow). To sign-up, contact us in Slack, or just sign-up at the meetup (time allowing). We will have a computer for you to present (or you can bring your own).

In absence of talks, we'll open it up to an informal discussion on AI's impact, and assess the state-of-the-art: what has your experience, in the last two years?
