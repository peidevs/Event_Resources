## JAN 2019

- cat-herder: 
- speaker 1 (unconfirmed): Adam LeBlanc GraphQL
- TODO: Adam will touch base beforehand to confirm the content of the talk.

### Misc

* consider reaching out to UPEI (e.g. Dr Gordon MacDonald) for an info session on the new Data Analytics program as part of the new School of Math and CS
* consider asking Paul Maxan to continue part 2 of navigation/satellite talk
    * user microp11 
    * part 1: [Issue 73](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues/73)
    * note part 2 seemed to make a lot of sense at the time, unclear if it does now
* An offer from Nolan Phillips about whatever. Dunno. We'll find out later. [Issue 74](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues/74)
* Consider touching base with Kelly Halseth in 2019 to talk about Code for Canada (contact M. Easter for details)
