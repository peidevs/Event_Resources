### Misc

* consider reaching out to UPEI (e.g. Dr Gordon MacDonald) for an info session on the new Data Analytics program as part of the new School of Math and CS

    * part 1: [Issue 73](https://github.com/peidevs/Event_Resources/issues/73)
    * note part 2 seemed to make a lot of sense at the time, unclear if it does now
